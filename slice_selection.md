## Slice Selection and Switching Mechanism 

A UE-initiated slice selection mechanism was developed and tested on Amarisoft network using a **Raspberry Pi 4**  with a **Quectel RM520N-GL** modem.


Modem Firmware: RM520NGLAAR03A03M4G. 

For communication and modem control AT Commands, QMI protocol and quectel-CM were used. 


### Necessary tools and drivers 

1. Quectel-CM , data call tool provided by the Support of Quectel Forums after request.

This mechanism relies on the capability of the modem to initiate PDU Session Establishment Requests tied to different Slices. More specifically, it was possible to create PDU profiles with specific parameters, including DNN, S-NSSAI and activate them to connect to the network using the quectel data call tool.


1. Install required packages
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libqmi-utils busybox minicom iproute2 ethtool
```

2. Create a new dir and download Quectel-CM 
```
mkdir Quectel 
unzip Quectel_QConnectManager_Linux_V1.6.8.zip
```
Inside the folders that were created after unzip:

```
make
```

### Make `quectel-CM` accessible from any path

To run `quectel-CM` from any directory, add it to your system PATH using a symbolic link.

1. Find the exact path of `quectel-CM`

```
2. sudo ln -s <FULL_PATH_TO_quectel-CM> /usr/local/bin/quectel-CM
```


3. Check if the modem is recognized by Linux kernel as a USB device

```
lsusb
```
Expected output:
```
Bus 002 Device 003: ID 2c7c:0801 Quectel Wireless Solutions Co., Ltd. RM520N-GL
```



4. Find the primary serial device node under /dev/ttyUSB* (usually /dev/ttyUSB2) and access it with minicom:

```
sudo minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB2
```

5. Activate the ECHO mode: 
```
Control + A , then press E
```

The main AT command interface is now open.

6. Set the modem to QMI mode. This is necessary only the **first time** you configure the modem. If it is already configured **skip steps 6 and 7**. 

```
AT+QCFG="usbnet",0 

OK
```

7. Reboot the modem
```
AT+CFUN=1,1
```

8. Allow to establish multiple PDU Connections with the same DNN. It is necessary in order to create PDU Profiles with the same DNN. Only the **first time** you configure the modem. 
```
AT+QCFG="pdp/duplicatechk",1 
```

9. **Create PDU Profiles**
For defining PDU Session Parameters. Each profile is identified by CID number. The following parameters are configured for this implementation:

- PDU_type (IPV4V6,IPV4,IPV6,PPP)
- DNN (internet, ims, default)
- S-NSSAI : The Slice you want to connect to. 

Check the available profiles:
```

AT+CGDCONT?

+CGDCONT: 1,"IPV4V6","default","0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,"",,,,0
+CGDCONT: 2,"IPV4V6","ims","0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,"",,,,0
+CGDCONT: 3,"IPV4V6","sos","0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0",0,0,0,1,,,,,,,,,"",,,,0
+CGDCONT: 4,"IPV4V6","internet_EMBB00000B","0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,0,"01.00000B",,,,0
+CGDCONT: 5,"IPV4V6","internet_EMBB00000C","0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0",0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,0,"01.00000C",,,,0

OK
``` 


Add a new profile:
```
AT+CGDCONT=<CID>, <Access_Type>,<DNN>, ,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,<S-NSSAI>,

For example:
AT+CGDCONT=6,"IPV4V6","internet",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,"01",
```

Notes: 

- It is recommended to NOT modify profiles 2 and 3. 
- You can NOT add a S-NSSAI to CID 1.



10. (Optional) Update the default configuration NSSAI stored at the modem to include the new Slices you entered. 

```
AT+C5GNSSAI=<dfl_nssai_len>,<dfl_config_nssai>
```

11. Get updates about Registration Status.
```
AT+C5GREG=2

OK
```


The PDU Profiles are now configured. For establishing a PDU Session with a specific profile quectel-CM is utilised. 


**If qmi_wwan driver is used, only one PDU Session can be activated.**


Check which driver is used: (Default qmi_wwan)
```
sudo ethtool -i wwan0
```

12. Check if the device node exists. This is the QMI control interface. 
```
ls /dev/cdc-wdm*

Expected output: /dev/cdc-wdm0
```

#### A. Driver qmi_wwan (default)

13. Check if the wwan0 interface is created successfully. This is the network interface for carrying the IP traffic. 

```
ip a 

 wwan0: <POINTOPOINT,MULTICAST,NOARP> mtu 1500 qdisc noop state DOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/none

```

14. Activate the PDU Profile of your choice:
```

sudo ./quectel-CM -n <CID number>
```
For example if you want to activate Profile with CID 5:
sudo ./quectel-CM -n 5 


15. Check if the connection is successful. The wwan0 must obtain an IP. Then test ping and iperf3 
```
4: wwan0: <POINTOPOINT,MULTICAST,NOARP,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/none
    inet 172.16.222.212/29 scope global wwan0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 fe80::a5a4:7e0c:7865:7e25/64 scope link stable-privacy
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```
